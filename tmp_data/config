# Haven't yet decided if we want to source this in `conf`, or perhaps
# confusingly enough use `mk-conf` to parse a .cfg file.

# Sets editor with which to edit config files. Defaults in descending order:
#  4. emacs    (if installed)
#  3. vim      (if installed)
#  2. $EDITOR  (environment variable)
#  1. $editor  (set in this file)
editor=

# Should `conf` automatically sort newly inserted entries? If a non-falsy
# argument (false, no, '') is passed, it is assumed to be a valid paramater to
# `sort -k`. If not valid, sets to '2' (name).
# Default is 'false'
auto_sort=

# Should `conf` automatically fit newly inserted lines to columnar output?
# Default is 'false'
auto_column=false

# Sets output & debug level. Specify in the format of LOW[,HIGH]. This setting
# is overridden by an explicitly set --debug flag. Levels are as follows:
#  -2  TRASH  You should pretty much never need to see this
#  -1  NOISE  Only for *very* verbose debugging
#   0  DEBUG  Regular debug messages, verbose output
#   1  INFO   Informational, take it or leave it
#   2  WARN   Something's gone a little awry, but hasn't exploded
#   3  CRIT   Something has exploded
# Default is '2,3'
debug_level=2,3
