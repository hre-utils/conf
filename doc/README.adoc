Quickly open & edit configuration files.

(WORK IN PROGRESS--very much a rough draft)

== General Information
Despite the shared name '`conf`', there is no relation to https://github.com/hre-utils/mk-conf[mk-conf].

This is the bash successor to a similar project I wrote in Python.
To adhere to the consistency of my other HRE utils, a ground-up rewrite was in order.

=== What this is
Small CLI utility to quickly open a specified config file in your editor of choice.
Linux systems tend to spray config files across your entire filesystem, with little regard to standards.
Or perhaps they all follow their own standard.
https://xkcd.com/927/[This] comes to mind.
The irony is not lost on me, as I create my own mini software suite filled with purely internal '`standards`'.
